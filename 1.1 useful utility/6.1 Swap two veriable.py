x = 5
y = 10

x, y = y, x
print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)
# If the variables are both numbers, we can use arithmetic operations to do the same. It might not look intuitive at first sight. But if you think about it, it is pretty easy to figure it out. Here are a few examples

# (Addition and Subtraction
# x = x + y
# y = x - y
# x = x - y


# Multiplication and Division
# x = x * y
# y = x / y
# x = x / y


# XOR swap
# This algorithm works for integers only

# x = x ^ y
# y = x ^ y
# x = x ^ y)
